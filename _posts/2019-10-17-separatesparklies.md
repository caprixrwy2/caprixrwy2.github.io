In this assignment we started using Arduino for the first time! We had to make three different codes that imitated different flash patterns for fireflies! 

The first code, the Flash Bulb firefly, was to intended to flash for half a second, wait four seconds and repeat! 
The second code, the Synchronous firefly, was supposed to flash three times fast and wait ten seconds before repeating. 
The third code, the Big Dipper firefly, was intended to linearly increase in brightness then turn off every three seconds.

This is a picture of the lilypad lighting up during the running of the synchronous firefly code:

A tip I would give to my past self is to not think of Arduino as something complete separate from C, a lot of the things that work in C also work in Arduino!
