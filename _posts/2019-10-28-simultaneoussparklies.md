title: Simultaneous Sparklies Coding Assignment  
gh-badge: [arduino, coding, CSCI103, computer science]

In this assignment, we were supposed to use the three separate firefly patterns that we had coded for and turn it into one single code that would make each one go off on the same pattern. 
This assignment was more difficult than the last because rather than being able to use delays, which would have offset all four of the fireflies, many variables had to be made in order to make each light go off at the same time. 
This is the arduino board in which all four of the lights are on:

A tip I would give to myself is to always try and think of ways to make the code more simple because it makes it easier for myself to understand.
