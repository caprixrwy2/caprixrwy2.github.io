title: Random Color Coding Assignment

In this assignment we were supposed to create a code that would create a random color (by generating random values for the red, green and blue lights on the arduino pad).
Additionally, the light should only turn on when the button is pressed. 

Here is a photo of the button being pressed, giving a blue light:

And pressed again, producing a random pink color:

A tip I would give to myself is to keep looking at my past codes, specifically the one I did for the simultaneous sparklies because they give a lot of helpful information, even if they're unrelated.
