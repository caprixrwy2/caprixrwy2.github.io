In this code we were supposed to make up a code, using temperature and light sensors, that would act as a 'ghost detector.' This means that whenever it is cold or dark, the red lights on the board would turn on. 
Here is a photo in which 'cold' is considered room temperature and the felt covering the light sensor is considered dark enough:

A tip I would give to myself is that whenever the code doesn't seem to be working, to jostle around the alligator clips because sometimes the issue is with the connection, rather than the code.
