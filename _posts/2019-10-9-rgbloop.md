title: RGB Loop Coding Assignment
gh-badge: [c, coding, CSCI103, computer science]
---

In this assignment we were to use C to create a code that would print Red, Green, or Blue at each multiple of 10. The code has to print three reds, then three greens, then three blues and then back to red. The code should use a while statement that will make the code loop, counting down from the inputed integer runTimes until it reaches zero.

For example, if one were to input 100 for runTimes, the output would look like this.

A hint to my past self is: don't be afraid to make a new integer!
