In this assignment we were supposed to create a code that, upon entering values 0 or 1 for the btn and swt variables, would then change the values of the led1, led2, and led3 variables. The code would then check the values of each led variable individually and print 'on' if the value was 1 or 'off' if the value was 0. 
If one were to input
swt:1
btn:0 
the output would be
![offoutput](https://caprixrwy2.github.io/img/offoffoff.jpg)

if one were to input 
swt:0
btn:0
the output would be 
![onoutput](https://caprixrwy2.github.io/img/ononon.jpg)

A tip I would give to myself is to really understand what the assignment was asking for because I didn't think about the two step process of the code and thought that I could go directly off of the values of the btn and swt variables.
