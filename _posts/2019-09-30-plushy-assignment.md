In this assignment, we were asked to use the LED lights, Arduino buttons and switches, felt, needle and thread to create a plushy that, upon pressing the button, would light up the LEDs.

Our first step was to try to prototype the electrical components. We began with using alligator clips in the place of conductive thread:

Next, we prototyped the plushy itself on paper. Using pencil, we marked out where we were going to stitch and the positive and negative sides of the electrical components.

Finally we were able to put all the prototypes to work. Here is the back of my plushy:

And the front of my plushy:

Tip: It is always worth checking and rechecking where your positives and negatives are again and again, over and over!
