In this assignment, we were told to create two homemade buttons using conductive thread and fabric. Only when both buttons were pressed would the LED turn on. We were also told to pay closer attention to the aesthetic of the piece meaning, keeping the stitches on the right side small and keeping unnecessary things, such as the battery holder, on the wrong side. 
First, we were asked to create a paper prototype of our homemade switches:

Next, we were to create an alligator clip prototype (a medium fidelity prototype):

Finally, I created the actual prototype (high fidelity)!

Here is the back:

Here is the front:

And here is the project lit up (because the my desk lamp is on, it is hard to see the light of the LED, but you can see the red tint from its light!):

A tip I would give to my future self is to always visualise what the right and wrong sides would look like before making the stitches. Doing so saves much more time than realising you stitched wrong and having to redo it!
