title: The Wearable Thermometer
---
This is a headband that will take your temperature and depending on the temperature, will glow different colors and will buzz at different frequencies. If the person is colder than average, the light will be blue, if they are average temperature, the light will be green and if the person has a fever, the light will be red. At the same time, the buzzer will buzz faster if the temperature is higher and slower if the temperature is lower. 

This is the front of my paper prototype, just by doing the digital version, I can tell that I am going to run into issues regarding the conductive threads and making sure that when they overlap, they do not touch.
