In this assignment, we were asked to create a code using conditional statements that, upon inputing different number values for temp, would give different responses. 
For example, if temp=-23:

![neg23](http://caprixrwy2.github.io/img/sweaterweather-neg23.png)

And if temp=72:

![pos70](http://caprixrwy2.github.io/img/sweaterweather-70.png)

and if temp=200: 

![pos200](http://caprixrwy2.github.io/img/sweaterweather-200.png)

The advice I would give to my future self is to not over complicate things. The final result was much simpler than I thought it would be!
