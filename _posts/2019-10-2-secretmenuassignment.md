title: Secret Menu Coding Assignment 
gh-badge: [c, coding, CSCI103, computer science]

In this assignment we were supposed to create a code with c that practices nested if statements. We had two variables: numberchoice and menuoption. If numberchoice was even then the regular menu was used. If numberchoice was odd then the special menu was used. 
If you inputed 
Numberchoice:30
Menuoption:2
then the output would be:

![regularmenu](https://caprixrwy2.github.io/img/regularmenu2.jpg)

If you inputed 
Numberchoice:31 
Menuoption:1
then the output would be:

![specialmenu](https://caprixrwy2.github.io/img/specialmenu1.jpg) 

If you inputed
Numberchoice:30
Menuoption:21
then the option would be:
