title: Final Project - The Wearable Thermometer 
gh-badge: [arduino, coding, CSCI103, computer science, final project]
---

The Wearable Thermometer is a headband with an Arduino temperature sensor sewn on the inside and LEDs and buzzer on the outside. When the wearer is under average body temperature, the lights will turn blue, if they are a healthy body temperature, the lights will turn green and when they are above average body temperature (have a fever) the lights will turn red. Additionally, the buzzer will change in frequency depending on the temperature of the wearer, slower for cold and faster as the temperature goes up. If the temperature is out of bounds (60 degrees for too cold and 120 degrees for too hot) the on-board LEDs will shine a bright white light to let the wearer know that they are out of bounds/need to recalibrate it. I decorated the sides of the head band with embroidery depicting a hot cup of tea, medicine and a thermometer to remind the wearer how to take care of themselves in the case that they do have a fever 

I wanted to make this thermometer because at home, my family never has one. We always go off of our feelings and I wanted to have a more reliable way of telling temperature in the Yuen household. 

For this project, I needed:
* 1 LilyPad LED 
* 1 buzzer
* 1 Switch 
* 1 Temperature Sensor 
* 1 Sewable Battery Holder 
* 1 Coin Cell Battery 
* Conductive Thread 
* Scissors
* Needles 
* Muslin Cloth 
* White Felt 
* Black and Red Embroidery Floss 
* White Fabric Paint to insulate

Here is my alligator clips prototype when the temperature is out of bounds (I changed the lower bound for the photo):

Here is my alligator clip prototype when it is room temperature:

Finally, here are photos of my project working! 

room temperature (below average body temperature):

fever temperature (using a hair dryer to heat it up):

and regular body temperature (taken as the temperature sensor cooled down from the hair dryer heat):

Here is the back of my final project, where you can see the insulation of my traces:

The tips I would give to my past self are: 

(1) to insulate your traces really well, be generous with the fabric paint

(2) to take good care of your Arduino board, it's disorienting to have to use a new one (but not impossible!) 

(3) to check your connection when doing your alligator clip prototype, sometimes it was the issue of the connection rather than the code 

(4) to trust yourself! You know how to do this!
