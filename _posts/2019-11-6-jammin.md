In this assignment, we were supposed to find already-made arduino code for any music. We were then supposed to use the switch and have it so that the buzzer only played the music when the switch was turned 'on.' 

A tip I would give to myself is to ask the TA's whether or not the music code could be turned off or on. I originally wrote my own code for music that I wanted and although it worked, it wouldn't work with anything I did with the switch.
