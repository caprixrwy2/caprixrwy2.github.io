title: Array Coding Assignment

In this assigment, we were supposed to use arrays. We were to make a code that would choose a random pin every second and if that pin were already on, it would turn it off but if the pin is off, it would assign a random value to the random pin.

A tip I would give to myself is to make your integers distinct because similarly named integers can be really confusing to keep track of!
