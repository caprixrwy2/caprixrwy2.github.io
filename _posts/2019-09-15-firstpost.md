title: My First post!

My name is Riley Yuen, graduating class of 2023. For now I am intrested in a double major in art history and sociology but that is always subject to change. I love sewing. My grandfather used to be a tailor so he taught me how to sew, even though I am not very good at it, I like to modify my own clothes and hem my shirts. I have absolutely no programming experience. At all. I would really love to learn just anything regarding programming and code in this class. And a boring fact about me is that pineapple is my favorite fruit.
