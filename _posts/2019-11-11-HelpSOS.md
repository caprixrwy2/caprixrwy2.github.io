tags: [arduino, compsci, coding]

In this assignment, we were supposed to create a code that would program our new Arduino vibe board to send out the morse code version of my name "RILEY" when the switch is on and buzz the morse code of "SOS" when the switch is off.
In the code, we were supposed to create new functions for each of the SOS vibe code and the name vibe code which helped simplify all the code in the void loop section. 

Here is a photo of the circuit set up:

A tip I would give to past self is to know that the code looks much simpler than I think it will!
