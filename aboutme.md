My name is Riley Yuen, class of 2023. A few facts about me, boring or not:

- I'm from New York City
- My dog has two teeth total

What else do you need?

### My Elevator Pitch

I am Riley Yuen, a local New Yorker who now lives attends Williams College! This fall semester, I chose to take my first ever Computer Science course. While many kids in my high school chose to take computer science, I opted for taking a third language and, fortunately or unfortunately, never got to experience the stress of a malfunctioning code that my friends were always complaining about. I have been very interested in fashion design for the longest time, even to the point of considering going to art school to study fashion design
