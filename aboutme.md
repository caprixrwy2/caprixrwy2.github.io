### My Elevator Pitch

I am Riley Yuen, a local New Yorker who now lives attends Williams College! This fall semester, I chose to take my first ever Computer Science course. While many kids in my high school chose to take computer science, I opted for taking a third language and, fortunately or unfortunately, never got to experience the stress of a malfunctioning code that my friends were always complaining about. I wanted to take CSCI 103 because I think that in our day and age, where technology and coding is always the hot topic, I also have to keep up and understand what coding is and know how to do some myself. I also love sewing and altering my own clothes so I was interested in this class, because it combined both my love for fashion and clothing and my curiousity in computer science as an emerging titan in our modern world
